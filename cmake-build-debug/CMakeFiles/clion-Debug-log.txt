CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindCyberConfig.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "CyberConfig", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "CyberConfig" with
  any of the following names:

    CyberConfigConfig.cmake
    cyberconfig-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "CyberConfig" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "CyberConfig_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "CyberConfig" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
