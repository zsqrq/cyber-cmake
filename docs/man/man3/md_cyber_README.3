md_cyber_README \- Introduction 
Apollo Cyber RT is an open source, high performance runtime framework designed specifically for autonomous driving scenarios\&. Based on a centralized computing model, it is greatly optimized for high concurrency, low latency, and high throughput in autonomous driving\&.
.PP
During the last few years of the development of autonomous driving technologies, we have learned a lot from our previous experience with Apollo\&. The industry is evolving and so is Apollo\&. Going forward, Apollo has already moved from development to productization, with volume deployments in the real world, we see the demands for the highest level of robustness and performance\&. Thatâ€™s why we spent years building and perfecting Apollo Cyber RT, which addresses that requirements of autonomous driving solutions\&.
